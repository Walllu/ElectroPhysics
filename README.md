# ElectroPhysics : Year 3 Computational Physics Group Project
## Built in C++

This project (currently) implements an experimental FTCS solver of parabolic PDE. Originally made for the solution of the Heat Diffusion Equation in a number of initial conditions, we reimplemented this in C++, and refactored it to work in more general, "negative temperature" initial condition situations. This effectively creates a "potential diffusion" simulation, that is of the same form as the HDE.

Our purpose with this project is to create a general solver of the electric potential of a number of situations. Noting the form of Laplace's equation, this program will simulate the "diffusion" of electric potential, and at a point when it's diffusion is negligible, it will have created a solution that is effectively Laplace's equation.

We still need to create:
 * General initial condition solver
 * Plotting
